mySQL(i) Getting Started -> open Wamp -> MyAdminPhp

go to sidebar - New - create new db, collection = "Collection"

the db for this project is called - "mini_project_db"


***  Starting: ***

ID field...

on average, the standard length for an int ID field would be 11

"default" ...
"collection" ... unknown...

attributes = unsigned -> positive integer values only

index = primary

"A_I" -> auto-increment => Check



varchar vs char
varchar = if you set length = 255 but only occupy 20 in the actual entry: the db stores only 20 in the db; efficient
char => as above; this always stores 255, with whitespace to pad... inefficient


---------------------------------------

mySQLi -> mySql "improved"...

check w3schools, different methods are:


###### object-oriented
- syntax uses "->";   

      $conn = new mysqli();
      if($conn->connect_error) {}


###### procedural
- syntax is just regular;

      $conn = mysqli_connect();
      if(!$conn) {}


###### pdo
- requires an extra download but allows implementation of try/catch...
