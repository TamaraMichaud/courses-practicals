"Everything is an object..." (mostly)

Primitive Objects
- Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null

Everything Else...
- Arrays, Functions, Objects, Dates, Wrappers for Numbers/Strings/Booleans


--------------------------------------------------
Object constructors and Instances (normally called a "class"... here we say "constructor" or "prototype"


--------------------------------------------------
Inheritance


e.g. Person constructor,   AND  Athlete constructor... 
     An Athlete is a type of person... with extra properties, 
     so the Athlete object should inherit the methods and properties of the Person object....

     This is done using "prototypes"; every object has a prototype property
